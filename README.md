# Telecom Customer Churn Detection

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on their usage patterns, service subscriptions, and demographic information.

The goal is to help telecom companies identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention measures.
