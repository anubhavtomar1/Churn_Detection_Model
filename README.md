# Telecom Customer Churn Detection

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on their usage patterns, service subscriptions, and demographic information.

The goal is to help telecom companies identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention measures.

## Objectives

Analyze customer behavior data
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
Train and evaluate machine learning models
Predict customer churn with high accuracy
Provide insights that support business decisions

## Technologies Used

Python
Pandas – data manipulation
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization
Scikit-learn – machine learning models & evaluation
Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer-level information including:
Demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen)
Account details (tenure, contract type, payment method)
Services used (internet, phone, streaming)
Billing information (monthly charges, total charges)
Target variable: Churn

## Methodology

Data Exploration
Understanding distributions and correlations
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
Model Training
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest (if applicable)
Evaluation
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Results

The model successfully identifies churn-prone customers
Key churn indicators include:
Short tenure
High monthly charges
Month-to-month contracts
Model performance metrics are analyzed and compared to choose the best-performing approach
